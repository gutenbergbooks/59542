"JAKE MILLER HANGS HIMSELF"
ILLUSTRATIONS
Three seconds later the two youngsters had the ear of Anderson Crow
"Wha—what was that you said?" gasped her husband, flopping back in the seat
Then, a hundred feet ahead, his lights fell upon the dauntless, abandoned flivver
Words failed Mr. Crow
The Rev. Mr. Maltby, pastor of the Congregational Church, happened to be passing the town hall
Several heartbroken gentlemen threatened to shoot themselves
"The celebrated Anderson Crow?" asked the man with the glasses
The Marshal started off in the direction of the "shanty"
"I—I surrender! I give in!" he yelled
Something terrible must have happened or Marshal Crow wouldn't be summoned in any such imperative manner as this
In the centre of this group was the new candidate for town marshal
Harry Squires stepped to the front of the platform
When they appeared on the street together
He altered his course, and as she passed him, the flat of the spade landed with impelling force
Eight or ten people were congregated in front of the Fry house
The veiled lady made her daily excursions in the big high-powered car
Yanking open the screen-door, he plunged headlong into the softly lighted veranda
He was surrounded by conquerors
Over him stood two men with pistols levelled at the white, terrified face
"Hold on, Mort!" called out Mr. Crow. "Don't monkey with that trunk"
His wife was now standing guard over it on the porch of the Grand View Hotel
These smiling, complacent women formed the Death Watch that was to witness the swift, inevitable finish of the Sunlight Bar
At the trial he was shamelessly complimentary about Mrs. Nixon's pie
"I am going to reveal to you the true facts in the case of our late lamented friend, Jake Miller"
